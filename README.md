# Sublime Text Competitive Programming Setup
I just like to share my sublime setup for competitive programming

### Snippet

  `minimalist`        -> my main cp template
  
  `fast-input`        -> for those who need input data fast
  
  `minim-fast-input`  -> cp template with fast input added
  
  `pb_ds`             -> pb_ds data structure
  
  `RNG`               -> best random number generator
  
  `gp_hash_table`     -> anti anti-unordered_map testcase

### Build System

  `CMS`               -> For IOI style build system
  
  `Debug`             -> For debugging (I rarely use it)
  
  `Run only`          -> For running already compiled program
  
  `Run automatically` -> Run c++ file automatically after compiles it
