# sublime-cp-setup
I just like to share my sublime setup for competitive programming

Snippet
  a. minimalist        -> my main cp template 
  b. fast-input        -> for those who need input data fast
  c. minim-fast-input  -> cp template with fast input added
  d. pb_ds             -> pb_ds data structure
  e. RNG               -> best random number generator

Build System
  CMS               -> For IOI style build system
  
  Debug             -> For debugging (I rarely use it)
  
  Run only          -> For running already compiled program
  
  Run automatically -> Run c++ file automatically after compiles it
